# Loxone-Hue-Scene-Controller

This repository contains a Pico C script to integrate Philips Hue scenes with a Loxone smart home system. Based on the original work by [Marcel Schreiner](https://github.com/marcelschreiner/loxone-hue-picoc).

## Documentation
Visit the [full documentation](https://alexkwarts.github.io/loxone-hue-scene-controller/) for detailed setup instructions, including images and step-by-step guides.

## Overview
The script bridges your Loxone Miniserver and Philips Hue lights, allowing Loxone inputs (e.g., buttons or sensors) to control pre-set Hue scenes (like "Relax" or "Bright").
